<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>
<p>
Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product
numbers and are intended to:
<ol>
  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components,
  and</li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to
  set end user expectations.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R
- where:
<ul>
  <li><b>M = Major</b>.  A difference in M indicates a break in
  compatibility.</li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>.  A difference in S indicates source
  compability.  That is, the user's source doesn't require change, but
  <i>does</i> require rebuilding.</li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>.  A difference in R indicates an introduction
  of new features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not
  broken.  If libraries are provided by the package, an application
  must re-link with the new libraries, but not rebuild from source.</li>
</ul>
</p>
