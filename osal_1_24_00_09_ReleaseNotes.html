<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
This OSAL product contains an Operating System Adaptation Layer interface,
as well as a concrete implementation for Linux.  This product is
very new and direct users should plan on some interface churn.  Compatibility
breaks may appear in the next major release.
</p>

<p>
Primary packages in this OSAL release are briefly described here.
(There are others, see the <a href="xdoc/index.html">Configuration Reference
Guide</a> documentation for a complete package list.)
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b><tt>ti.sdo.utils.loggers</tt></b> - LoggerFlex implementation
           that includes Task Ids
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>ti.sdo.xdcruntime.linux</tt></b> - Port of XDC Runtime
           to Linux user mode
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, a few examples are also provided.
<ul>
    <li>A "Hello World" example has been provided in two flavors; one, that uses pre-build OSAL libraries, and another that builds OSAL.
    </li>       
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>
<p>
The OSAL packages are available in the "packages/"

OSAL product, you can install this release next to it, and
modify your builds to use this newer release.</p>

  <li>OSAL 1.24.00.09 builds upon, and redistributes, XDC Tools

<p>
Note, if you're upgrading from a release earlier than OSAL 1.23.00.04, be
sure to review the <b>Upgrade</b> section for each of the releases between
your current OSAL release and this one.  Previous release notes are
available in the <a href="relnotes_archive">relnotes_archive</a> directory.

If migrating from a release prior to OSAL 1.23.00.04, consult previous
releases available in the <a
href="relnotes_archive">relnotes_archive</a> directory.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility Key Definitions</h3>
<p>
Compatibility keys are intentionally independent of Marketing product
numbers and are intended to:
<ol>
  <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components,
  and</li>
  <li>Convey a level of compatibility between different releases to
  set end user expectations.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Compatibility keys are composed of 3 comma-delimited numbers - M,S,R
- where:
<ul>
  <li><b>M = Major</b>.  A difference in M indicates a break in
  compatibility.</li>
  <li><b>S = Source</b>.  A difference in S indicates source
  compability.  That is, the user's source doesn't require change, but
  <i>does</i> require rebuilding.</li>
  <li><b>R = Radix</b>.  A difference in R indicates an introduction
  of new features, but compatibility with previous interfaces has not
  broken.  If libraries are provided by the package, an application
  must re-link with the new libraries, but not rebuild from source.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Validation">Validation</a></h2>
<p>
This release was built and validated against using the following software
components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>XDCtools <b>3.25.00.48</b></li>
  <li>SYS/BIOS <b></b></li>
  <li>Pre-built binaries were built with the following toolchains:
    <ul>
<!-- autogenerated list -->
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

 <hr>
<h2><a name="Noteworthy">Noteworthy</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The package ti.sdo.utils.loggers is no longer supported in this package.  </li>
  <li>OSAL product now includes prebuilt libraries for multiple targets, hence the location of these libs has changed. </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>An eclipse plugin is not provided in this release.  Product
    integration has changed in CCSv5.1 and migration to the new format
    was not possible in time for this release.  This integration support
    may be restored in a future release.  Most OSAL users are not CCSv5
    users, so this is not a critical feature.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>OSAL examples and instructions are located in the
"examples" directory.
</p>
<!-- TODO
<ul>
  <li><a href="examples/build_instructions.html">Example Build
  Instructions</a></li>
</ul>
-->

<hr>
<h2><a name="Version">Version Information</a></h2>
<p>
This product's version follows a version format, <b>M.mm.pp.bb</b>,
where <b>M</b> is a single digit Major number, <b>mm</b> is 2 digit
minor number, <b>pp</b> is a 2 digit patch number, and <b>b</b> is an
unrestricted set of digits used as an incrementing build counter.
</p>

<p>
To support multiple side-by-side installations of the product, the
product version is encoded in the top level directory,
ex. <b>osal_1_24_00_09</b>.
</p>

<p>
Subsequent releases of patch upgrades will be identified by the patch
number, ex. OSAL 1.24.01.XX with directory <b>osal_1_24_01_XX</b>.
Typically, these patches only include critical bug fixes.
